Learn AWS by doing ... 

I want to share some thoughts on how I learned <b>AWS Cloud </b> and if AWS Certification were part of it.
I think it would be good to share it.

Currently I have 6 AWS Certification including 2 Professinal levels. Does it mean doing certificaiton gives knowledge you need to have ? 
Let's try to think about this.

If you are starting with Cloud you need to change your way of thinking . There are already services to use and you don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Whether you're looking for compute power, database storage, content delivery, or other functionality, AWS has the services to help you build sophisticated applications with increased flexibility, scalability and reliability

Steps I think are require before you start.

Try AWS with 3 easy steps

1.  Signup of course [AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)
2.  After setting up account please set up Billing Budget and Alert - this is really important - you don't want to pay too much
3.  Go for a short course that gives you basic idea what is about -  For example - [AWS Concept](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-concepts/) I didn't spent too much time on course
    

You know basic now so you can use services like AWS Lambda and serverless approach so let's use it.
Navigate to AWS.

Open Lambda function screen

Create Lambda:

Create Test Event:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post2/createtestevent.png)

Lanuch Lambda
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post2/LambdaExecution.png)


You can see how it easy it was . Did you had to create any server any virtual machine .. No just the code ..
You can now think  what else more complicated can be done here
For example:

This particual code will can be triggered every 24 hour by [AWS Cloud Watch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
<script src="https://gist.github.com/piotrgrota/62ef85a4f89c358f177cd2e6727dc3ca.js"></script>

I just show you how easy it is to create stuff in AWS but what about Certification. 
How much knowledge it gives to you ?

Well from my point which can be subjective it allow me to  see things from different angle and adjust missing point in my knowledge.
It was never my main source of knowledge in AWS but end up with several benefits for example:
s   
1.  I learned about memory docker inspired by one of the topic in Exam around Docker and limits

    *  Amazon ECS uses two parameters for allocating memory to tasks: memoryReservation (a soft limit) and memory (a hard limit). 
        The value for each parameter is subtracted from the available memory units of an Amazon ECS container instance when a task is running
        [Memory ECS Task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html)
2.  Network connection option Hybrid Cloud [AWS Hybrding Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/hybrid/)
3.  Internals DynamoDb and how to deal with it [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_PL&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=dynamodb_hv_b&sc_content=dynamodb_e&sc_detail=dynamodb&sc_category=dynamodb&sc_segment=102875050329&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=PL&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!102875050329!e!!g!!dynamodb&ef_id=CjwKCAjwkPX0BRBKEiwA7THxiHkSeQUSwqSzJo_7qAp3AsesxpaEF9GnRorZH_0l4gyWlZm3SUKoPhoCVYYQAvD_BwE:G:s)
4.  Redshift [RedShift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) and it's internal mechanisms
5.  Streaming Application and analysis particular [AWS Kinesis  Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/)
6.  Security Landing Zone [Landing Zone](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone/)
7.  Analyze Security data with Athena and Cloud Trail [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) and Cloud Trail (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)
8.  Any many more...    

I won't cover the whole list but You could see it is very broad

Ceritification gives a lot of knowledge but only if you are doing projects on your own You are really learning it.
I was doing my "internal" projects where I had to pay attention about cost since I am paying for my account and at the end of month someone needs to pay for it.


* If you want to prepare for Certifcation try 4 points below. 
<br/>

    1.  [AWS Digital Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/)
    2.  Practise on your own
    3.  Online Course for Certification but they shouln't be treated as the only source.
    4.  Practise tests I recommend those on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) or [Brain Cert](https://www.braincert.com/) 


* After Feeling confident you can try do a Practise test from AWS 
<br/>

    1.  Create Account [AWS Certification](https://www.aws.training/certification?src=exam-prep)
    2.  Usually 20-25 questions for practise Exam

You can ask are they different than real exam?

I can say yes . They were different but at least gives an idea how structure of questions will looks like.

You may ask how much time do you have on exam ?

It depends on exam itself .
My longest exam was [AWS Architect Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/)
It was around 3 hours and you had to be focus for all the time since questions were very verbose and complicated.

You may ask what is tested there ?
Questions are only closed with one or multiselect option. For example how you would build AWS infrastructure with such budget limit or restrictions? 
You are presented with many services and combination of them.


### Conclusion:

AWS Certification gives a lot of ideas, options ,expand your knowledge you can use in your Project but it should not be treated main source.
Just practise and do Your own projects.


PS:
Before my one of the exam I forgot to stop some of the AWS Services and had to pay more dollars at the end just to let you know I was also on [Free 12 month Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=tier%2312monthsfree)
